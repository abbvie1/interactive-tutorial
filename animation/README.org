Comparison of R packages that can produce interactive animations

All 4 methods below have these points in common:

- Interact with the plot to show/hide subsets of data.
- Animation.
- Multi-layer: several different geoms can be combined on the same plot (e.g. points and lines).
- The user only needs to write R code (not JavaScript).
- Plot rendered in a web browser using HTML and JavaScript (JS).

** animation 

If you want to interact with only one variable (time), then animation
is the best, since it offers a wide variety of export formats (web
page, MOV, animated GIF). To view an example, 
=source("animation.R")= in a subdirectory.

** animint

If you want to interact with several variables (not just time), then
animint is the best. However, the only kind of interaction that can be
expressed using animint is showing and hiding subsets of data, based
on the selected value of each interaction variable. To view an
example, =source("animint.R")= in a subdirectory.

** shiny + ggplot2 or ggvis

If you want other kinds of interactions, or you want to do
calculations on the server, then shiny is the best. Do
=shiny::runApp("shiny")= for ggplot2, and =shiny::runApp("ggvis")= for
ggvis.

** Future work

A translator that takes a list of ggplots with showSelected and
clickSelects aesthetics, and outputs a shiny app.
