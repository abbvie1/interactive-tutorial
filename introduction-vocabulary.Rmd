# A vocabulary for characterizing interactive graphics

This tutorial presents several R packages for making interactive
graphics. To begin, make sure to install the required packages:

```{r}
source("http://tdhock.github.io/interactive-tutorial/packages.R")
```

## Definition of interactive graphics

The R command line is interactive, so aren't all R graphics
interactive? Yes, if you have access to the data and R source
code. No, if you only have access to the graphic itself.

This tutorial uses the following definition: in an **interactive** or
**dynamic** graphic, the plot can be updated without changing the R
code. In a **non-interactive** or **static** graphic, the R code must
be changed to update the plot.

For example, the following is a static graphic

```{r}
lungDeaths <- cbind(mdeaths, fdeaths)
matplot(lungDeaths, type="l")
```

because it can be zoomed only by changing the R code:

```{r}
matplot(lungDeaths, type="l", xlim=c(20, 40))
```

In contrast, the following interactive graphic can be zoomed by
dragging the mouse on the plot (without changing the R code).

```{r}
dygraphs::dygraph(lungDeaths)
```

## Actions, effects, and complexity

We will use the terms **Actions** and **Effects** to categorize
different kinds of interactive graphics. In the graphic above, we see
several examples of **direct manipulation actions** which produce the
following effects:

| Action | Effect     |
|--------|------------|
| Hover mouse | Show x and y values |
| Drag mouse | Zoom x or y axis |
| Double click | Zoom out |

We use the term **direct manipulation** to describe **actions** near
the plotted data. This contrasts **indirect manipulation** on buttons
or menus which are typically located outside of the plotting region.

We will use some other terms to describe the **complexity** of a data
visualization. The complexity terms answer the following questions:

* How many layers? A single plot may have several layers or different
  geoms (points, lines, etc) that represent different parts of a
  complex data set. The data viz above is **single-layer** because it
  only displays one layer (lines).
* How many panels? A single plot may have several panels, each with
  its own axis. The data viz above is **single-panel** since it has
  only one panel.
* How many plots? A single data viz may have several linked plots,
  each with different axes and data. The data viz above is
  **single-plot** since it has only one plot.
  
## The shiny web server

The `shiny` package provides a web server that can be used for many
interactive graphics based on indirect manipulation actions. For
example, **multi-panel**, **multi-layer**, **single-plot** data viz
below uses **indirect manipulation** to show how the central limit
theorem works for data of different distributions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub('ShinySampleMean', 'ekstroem')
```

Another example with the same keywords to explain power calculations.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shiny::runGitHub('ShinyPower', 'ekstroem')
```

## Multi-plot data visualization

This is not in R, but [dc.js](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/) can be
used to create **multi-plot**, **single-panel**, **single-layer** data
visualizations with **direct manipulation actions**.

## Animation

The `animation` package can be used to produce **animated** data
visualizations which use **indirect manipulation** to scroll forward
and backward in time. For example
[this](http://nicholsonppp.r-forge.r-project.org/2009-08-19/index.htm)
is a **multi-plot**, **multi-panel**, **single-layer** data
visualization which shows the results of a simulation model of
evolution. Each animation update has two effects: **showing a new data
subset**, and **updating the highlighted generation** in the time
series plot.

# Summary of vocabulary

* **Actions**: direct manipuation (click, drag, hover), indirect
  manipulation (menus, buttons), animation.
* **Effects**: zoom, highlight, show/hide (data, labels, tooltips).
* **Complexity**: multi-panel, multi-layer, multi-plot.
